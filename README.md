# BankSimulator

Specifications:
## Create the Client and BankAccount Classes: 
You should implement the Client and BankAccount classes with their respective deposit and withdraw methods.

## Complete the Logic in Event Listeners:
 Inside the Event Listeners for the "Deposit" and "Withdraw" buttons, you should complete the necessary actions. This includes creating an instance of the client, calling the deposit or withdraw methods on the bank account, and then calling the updateBalance function to reflect the change in the DOM.

## Implement the Logic in updateBalance(): 
The updateBalance function should retrieve the current balance of the client's bank account and display it in the DOM. This can be done by updating the content of the corresponding HTML element.

## Create a New Client:
 Make sure to create an instance of the client at the beginning of the program so that deposit and withdrawal operations are performed on the client's account.
